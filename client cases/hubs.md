Title: The ultimate guide to lean/agile translaiton with Contentful

Target Group: Contentful users who have problems with their localization pipeline: CEO's, marketing mensjes, ...

Goal: to give a blue print on how to work with Contentful and TMSs, how current solutions are not working, and what the key insight is to make it work, and to have content flow in all languages. 


Intro:
The worlds of content management and translation management are, you could say, Venus and Mars. These different planets collide quite dramatically most of the time. For most companies, translation processes are the ones no-one in the content department wants to come close to, because they are too painful, always require rework and have a less than optimal result in terms of UX. 

So a lot of people turn to tools to solve this issue. (Or hire a translation project manager that will burn out within a year). They buy a content management system that promises to make sure you can publish to multiple channel and re-use your content. And the "mature" clients, as we call them, even buy a Translation Management System that integrates with that CMS. That should solve the problem. 

It appears that buying tools is not the answer. There are a lot of companies that have bought state of the art tools in both content management AND translation management and integrated this, and that are still struggling with their international content, in spite of the promise that everything would be solved by buying these tools. 

Somehow, there is no clear vision at CMS-companies on how to deal with translated content, and there is even less of a vision on how to create, manage and store your content on the side of translation tools. 

So in this article we will fill this gap. Written by Contentful-expert Dennis and Translation management expert Anouk, we have put together, from our own experiences, the ultimate guide to setting up both Contentful, and your integration with translation tools that will guarantee a happy ending: no defects, no rework, and re-usability in all languages. Which leads to the ultimate time to market, for all countries you want to reach.  

#h2 Outline

**General problems with translation**
This sections gives an overview of problems that arise when working in translation. 

- technical defects 
- rework on design 

**What is a TMS and why use it**
This section explains why it is important to work with a translation tool and not have the translators work in contentful

why would you not: (hier nog even wat verzinnen!!!)
- direct publishing. 
- clarity on structure of components

But: 
- translators are used to working in their tools, can't learn all the CMSs, steep learning curve
- update management
- licensing
- terminnology
- old translations (???)

So we will have to find a way to get the first half and not lose the second half

**Common setup with Contentful/TMS**
This section explains how translation is usually viewed, as a waterfall project, and the tools are standardly designed to work that way.
(het is toch eigenlijk niet te geloven van zo'n localize hoe ze dit hebben opgezet he)
comment van een toehoorder van de Design Night: "My previous company was one of the CMS providers, and I looked in-depth into the translation feature of competitors. And they all are reinforcing the old model. Designers & developers create page templates first, then content creators fill the content in CMS and the translators deliver the content to multi-language sites."
