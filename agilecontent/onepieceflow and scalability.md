# how to reach scalability with the learnings from the manufacturing industry

Target group: CEO's

Goal: explain what scalability is, how it applies to content creation and how to keep/make the process scalable by applying one piece flow


Problem: 
When companies are going into the localisation space, they experience that this slows them down, instead of the exponential growth they were hoping for. People get completely stuck in the translation process, which sometimes even leads to completely stopping 



Challenge:
Translation should never be the bottleneck when deploying content or products. Adding content or languages should not increase the number of people working on the process

The real cause of this problem: the content creation process is not robust, nor scalable. You don't really notice this until you start translating; then your waste multiplies by the number of languages you translate into. 



Solution: make your content process scalable

How do you do this: let localisation tell you where your bottleneck lies and use it to innovate your content process. 

Use one piece flow to understand where your real bottlenecks lie AND to allow yourself to start translating much sooner. 

- What is one piece flow? 

- how does it make processes scalable? 

- how does it increase your velocity?
