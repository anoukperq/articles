So you have a global content strategy. Now what? 


Target audience: CEO's

Goal: show that implementing a global content strategy does not equal hiring an LSP. It equals treating your content processes as a strategic part of your company, which 
means applying the same process methodologies as to your other primary processes.


- coming up with a global content strategy is not easy. It needs research, experimenting and constant adjusting to the ever changing world
- however, once you have your content strategy in place, the only thing you need to do is execute it. And for publishing in multiple languages, all you need to do is hire a translation agency. Right? 

Wrong.

Multiple reasons why this is not enough
- translation agencies can only execute part of your process. 
  -  many more steps that need to be optimized in order to reach your strategic goals
  -  risk of suboptimization 

- but also: 
  - your content strategy needs adapting on the basis of everything that happens in the process. 
  (something about only be able to adjust your strategy if you have a good view of what happens in the process - god knows if this is true)


 - most importantly: 
  - your internal, primary processes will have to change if you start publishing in more languages. 
  - you can't simply add localization to your organization and expect nothing to change
  - separating localization from your business processes will not give you the right results and might even lead to deterioration of the processes you would like to preserve.

Time to face reality: adding more languages will affect your internal organization. Better do it right than ignore it.
