So you have a global content strategy. Now what? 


Target audience: CEO's

Goal: show that implementing a global content strategy does not equal hiring an LSP. It equals treating your content processes as a strategic part of your company, which means applying the same process methodologies as to your other primary processes.


- Coming up with a content strategy is not easy. It needs research, measuring, experimenting and constant adjusting to the ever changing world
- Then, you got that figured out, you would like to expand that to multiple markets.  
- For publishing in multiple languages, all you need to do is hire a translation agency and everything will work out for itself. Right? 

Wrong.

- your content strategy needs adapting for different markets  
    => you may start with "just translating" to test the waters
    => then: if 


Multiple reasons why this is not enough
- translation agencies can only execute part of your process. 
  -  many more steps that need to be optimized in order to reach your strategic goals
  -  risk of suboptimization 

- but also: 
  


 - most importantly: 
  - your internal, primary processes and infrastructure will have to change if you start publishing in more languages. 
  - you can't simply add localization to your organization and expect nothing to change
  - separating localization from your business processes will not give you the right results and might even lead to deterioration of the processes you would like to preserve.

- One of the reasons; waste in creating content is going to multiply by the number of languages


Time to face reality: adding more languages will affect your internal organization. Better do it right than ignore it.
